    <p><h4>selamat datang di tentang saya</h4></p>    
    <br><p>I was born in Kalimantan, Tamiyang village, Tanta sub-district, Tabalong regency, my area is often called Warukin, I was born in 2006/12/30.
        When I was still in elementary school I liked a beautiful woman. At that time I was still in grade 3 of elementary school. I really loved her and really loved her with all my heart.
        After I graduated from elementary school and continued my schooling to junior high school, I was still in the same class as her. At that time, she became more beautiful and very kind-hearted. I was also very lucky to be able to sit behind her until "I felt, is this the meaning of soul mate.......
        but not long after that I heard the news that she was already with another man and it was very heartbreaking when I heard the news, the pain was unbearable because I heard the news that she was already with another man......
        A sick heart cannot be cured unless time continues to fade this pain.
        and when I was in the 9th grade of junior high school I was able to forget her and met a sweet woman from the island of Java and that was my first love with her. I was initially traumatized by falling in love. Slowly healing because of her arrival (9 March 2023 - 19 March 2023) that love The sweetness didn't last long and when he left I started to realize what my shortcomings were. I actively went to the gym to exercise and exercise every morning and by the afternoon it was all to forget about him and focus on pursuing my dream of becoming a soldier but that dream was also It didn't last long because I had shortcomings and wasn't perfect just because my teeth fell out of achieving my goals. At that time I would really give up hope and feel like I had no more hope for success, but I wouldn't give up because of the support of my parents and My mother's prayer is that I am very lucky because I chose to major in computer network engineering because I got a lot of experience and know about the outside world. I studied cyber security and hacking. There are many things and experiences that I have gained from all my studies to date (I confident that I will be successful in the future)</p>
